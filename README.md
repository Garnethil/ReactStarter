# Gabe's Node Starter Kit 

Welcome- This is a learning repo for learning how to setup node, and start a new react application. I will try to document here my learnings.

To start with I will be following this guide, although to be honest I will be trying to learn other tools that my team is using at work. But I will follow as close as possible.

# Differences against the tutorial

I installed babel using --save-dev. This is the recommendation in the babel website and it makes more sense as it is a DevTool. Also I installed babel-cli instead of babel-core. I have no idea what's the differences but I'm following the babel website instead.

# Setup
---
```
npm install
```

# Compile
---
```
npm run compile
```

# Random thigns I learned so far
## Node 
Nothing yet

## NPM

There are two distinct dependency closures that can be handled, you can add packages to the package.json by running npm install --save or --save-dev.

## Windows Bash
Your bash instance uses a different user, I had forgotten mine but it is really easy to change if you are an admin of the windows instance by changing the defaul lxss user to root, starting an elevated bash prompt and changing the user password.
