# Gabe's Node Starter Kit 

Welcome- This is a learning repo for learning how to setup node, and start a new react application. I will try to document here my learnings.

To start with I will be following this guide, although to be honest I will be trying to learn other tools that my team is using at work. But I will follow as close as possible.
